# Usage
After starting up this image you might want to grab the td_data folder to generate the queries.

This can be done be executing the following command when the container is running:

```
docker cp evaluation-graphql-server-techniques:/usr/td_data DEST_PATH
```

Where DEST_PATH is where you want it on your machine.
